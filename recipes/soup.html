    <h2>What does it mean to make Soup?</h2>
    <p>
      When I was a young lad, I always thought that soup was just a food. Now that I am older, I realize just how wrong I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      To truly understand soup, one must first look to the skies and ask, <i>"Who am I?"</i> Yes. Who <em>are</em> you?
    </p>

    <h2>Here's what you'll need:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>soup</li>
        <li>the will to live</li>
        <li>just a <strong>BUTT</strong> ton of gravy (to snack on later)</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>And here's how to make it:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Give up everything you know. Everyone you've ever loved? <strong>Dust.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Repent.</strong></li>
      <li>Make some soup, fuggetaboutit!</li>
    </ol>
