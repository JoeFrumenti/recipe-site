      <ul>
        <li>beans</li>
        <li>the will to live</li>
        <li>just a <strong>BUTT</strong> ton of gravy (to snack on later)</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>And here's how to make it:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Give up everything you know. Everyone you've ever loved? <strong>Dust.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Repent.</strong></li>
